#  get today, yesterday, and the day before yesterday, then convert the latter two to strings
today = date.today()
yesterday = str(today - timedelta(days=1))
day_before = str(today - timedelta(days=2))

## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday.
# Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
stock_json = requests.get(url=STOCK_ENDPOINT, params=stock_parameters).json()  # get full query JSON
stock_time_series = stock_json["Time Series (Daily)"]  # get the time series section of info

#  get closing stocks for yesterday and the day before, and caluclate their absolute difference
# TODO: count only weekdays when referring to "yesterday" and "day before"
data_list = [value for (key, value) in stock_time_series.items()] # returns a list of tuples
closing_stock_yesterday = float(data_list[0]["4. close"])
closing_stock_day_before = float(data_list[1]["4. close"])

# closing_stock_yesterday = float(stock_time_series[yesterday]["4. close"])
# closing_stock_day_before = float(stock_time_series[day_before]["4. close"])
closing_difference = abs(closing_stock_yesterday - closing_stock_day_before)
print(closing_difference)
if closing_stock_yesterday - closing_stock_day_before > 0:
    triangle = "ðŸ”º"
else:
    triangle = "ðŸ”»"

#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price. 
percent = closing_difference / closing_stock_yesterday
print(percent)

# if percent > 0.05:
#     print("Get News")


## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator
if percent < 0.05:
    print("generating articles")
    news_json = requests.get(url=NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=news_parameters).json()
    news_json_first_three_articles = news_json["articles"][:3]

    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    # Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.
    #HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.

    #  content for articles in tuple form, which I hope is a good approach
    article_text_content = [(entry["title"], entry["content"]) for entry in news_json_first_three_articles]

    #  for each tuple, text the headline and article content
    for entry in article_text_content:
        message = client.messages.create(
            body=f"{STOCK}: {triangle} {int(percent * 100)}%\n\n"
                 f"Headline: {entry[0]}\n\n"
                 f"Brief: {entry[1]}",
            from_=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
            to=RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER
        )

#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
